Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project we were givent the code for a treasure hunt game. The code that I needed to create was a Q-learning algorithm that directed the agent (pirate) to the treasure on the best path.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientist are developers of programs. They matter because in our current era there is a massive amount of data that is tracked used and stored and programmers are responsible for handling users data.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist I approach a problem by looking at what I am trying to solve. Then take it one step at a time and use iteration through my failures. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities are to ensure I am being transparent and keeping the end users data safe from harm.
